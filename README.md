Binary Logical Networks

Nodes connected layer by layer in a complete binary tree by logical operations from input to output. We are doing logical operations on numbers from 0.0 to 1.0 inclusive. Linear run time in number of nodes and for training, each data point training is also linear in the number of nodes. Runtime is linear in the bit size of the input. Constant factor approx. 2.

Work in progress.

Yes, I am unemployed and doing this for free.

Edit Nov 27 2017: I just started heavy chemo so please be patient.
